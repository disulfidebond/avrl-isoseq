Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) features full-length sequencing of transcripts. 

PacBio RNA Sequencing (RNASeq) leverages the capabilities of Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) Sequencing [to create reads that span whole transcripts and isoforms](). These [long read lengths](https://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/Application-Brief-RNA-sequencing-Best-Practices.pdf) allow more accurate variant detection, and the isoseq software allows comparisons of transcript isoforms (Bruijnesteijn_et_al_2018, Audano_et_al_2019).

The attached user manual from PacBio is verbose, but extremely useful, both as a reference, and a primer on important topics.
